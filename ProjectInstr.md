##### Let's build a contact list!

* Using the images below as a template/guide - build a simple contact list
* On your "home" view, show a list of all of the users in your user array.
* When I click on any of the users, I'm *routed* to a view with _that_ user's info.
* There should be a `back` button or icon to take me back to the home (list) view.
* The URL should also change to reflect the current resource I'm viewing.
